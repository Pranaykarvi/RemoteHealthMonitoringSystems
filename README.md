# Overview:
This health monitoring system uses Support vector machine (Svm) model to classify and predict various health conditions based on input medical data. Itâ€™s designed to help users make preliminary health assessments in an accessible way.

# Features:
- **Predictive analysis based on user input medical data.**
- **Simple, interactive interface built with Streamlit.**
- **Uses Svm model for reliable health condition prediction.**
# Installation:
- git clone https://github.com/pranaykarvi/health-monitoring-system.git
- cd health-monitoring-system
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- streamlit run App.py

This will open the app in your default web browser. Follow the prompts on the interface to input medical data and receive health condition predictions.
